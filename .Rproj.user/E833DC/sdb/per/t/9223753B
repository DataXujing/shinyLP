A [Landing page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page) is the first page of a web app or website that a user interacts with to learn the purpose, usage and status of the tool. The user experience and interface are important features to consider when developing Shiny applications to direct especially non-technical users how to use the application.\n\nThis package is inspired by the [shinyBS package](https://github.com/ebailey78/shinyBS) which incorporates useful components from the [Bootstrap web framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) for use in Shiny. shinyLP extends the Bootstrap components that are used in the Shiny package by making it easier by not having to write additional HTML code.\n\n## To-do prior to submitting to CRAN\n\n* unit tests\n* more examples on demo shiny app\n* additional bootstrap components I'm interested in implementing:\n    * [Media Objects](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#media-default)\n    * [List Group](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#list-group)\n    * [Badges](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#list-group-badges)\n    * [Wells](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#wells)\n\n## Example\n\n![](example.jpg)\n\n\n## How to install this package?\n\nTo install the package type the following (not on CRAN yet 08-26-2016):\n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"shinyLP\")\nlibrary(\"shinyLP\")\n```\n\nOr you can install the development version from Github:\n\n```r\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"jasdumas/shinyLP\")\nlibrary(shinyLP)\n```\n\n## How to use this package?\n\nThe components of the package are R functions that wrap HTML Bootstrap code. \n\nThis project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jasdumas/shinyLP/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).
